# Initial data wrangling

## Convert all variable names to snake case

```{r walkcode}

  .f = function(x) {

    df <- get(x)
    # Grab the variables names
    var_names <- names(df)
    # Convert variable names to snake case
    var_names <- str_replace_all(var_names, '(\\B)([A-Z])', '_\\2')
    # Convert variable names to lower case
    var_names <- str_to_lower(var_names)
    # Fix medstar_id
    var_names[var_names == "medstar_i_d"] <- "medstar_id"
    # assign back to the dataframe
    names(df) <- var_names
    # Replace df with new names in global environment
    assign(x, df, envir = .GlobalEnv)
