```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```


The merged data used below was created in data_01_import.Rmd.

```{r}
merged_followup <- read_rds("/Users/bradcannell/Desktop/merged_followup.rds")
```

Left off here...

I probably want to get some idea of what the metrics, graphs, etc look like outside of Shiny. I can use this file for that purpose. I can also refer to index.Rmd from the static dashboard. 

I may also want to get a handle on some basic Shiny functionality (e.g., filtering data on date) while I'm working on this process. That will take place in app.R.
